features:
  - A new role has been created, ``rpc_pre_upgrade`` to
    assist operators with capturing the state of an
    environment prior to an upgrade.
upgrade:
  - The ``rpc_pre_upgrade`` playbook performs the pre-upgrade
    steps as outlined in the RPC-O Maintenance Template. Output
    from the various steps are stored in 
    ``$HOME/rpc13-upgrade-<date-stamp>`` on the deployment server.
    These files should be closely examined prior to proceeding
    with the upgrade.
