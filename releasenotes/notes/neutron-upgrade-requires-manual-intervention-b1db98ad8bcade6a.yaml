upgrade:
  - Existing networks on a Liberty deployment using the
    ML2 plug-in will require manually updating the MTU
    value in the neutron.networks table before the upgrade
    begins.  Failure to do this may result in new
    instances on existing networks and rebooting existing
    instances to boot with an incorrect MTU, causing the
    instances to be inaccessible.  Please see the RPC v13
    upgrade documentation for more detailed information on
    how to avoid this situation.
